# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date**: 2024-11-17  

Playground (referred to as "the App") is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data the App accesses, how this data is handled, and the measures taken to safeguard user privacy.

## Data Collection and Use
The App collects and stores user input data locally on the device. This data may include:  
- User-created names and avatars.  
- Data related to activities involving the drag-and-drop functionality.  

No data is sent to external servers, third-party services, or transferred outside the local device.

## Permissions
The App requires permission to access photos stored on the device. This permission is used solely for:  
- Allowing users to create avatars using photos.  
- Customizing in-app experiences.  

The App does not store or transfer accessed photos outside the local device.

## Children’s Privacy
The App is designed to be child-friendly and does not collect personal information directly from children.  
- Teachers or guardians create names and avatars for child users.  
- Children interact with the App through drag-and-drop activities only.  
- All data remains securely stored on the local device.  

Parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise app use to ensure their child’s experience aligns with their expectations.

## No Network Activity
The App does not make network requests or connect to the internet for its functionality. All operations are performed and stored locally on the user’s device.

## Data Security
The App prioritizes data security. Although the data is stored locally, users are encouraged to protect their devices with appropriate security measures (e.g., passwords, encryption) to prevent unauthorized access.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated "Effective Date" at the top of the policy. Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how their data is handled.
